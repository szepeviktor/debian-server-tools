- Notify on account breach: search all details https://sec.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/ilc/search
- Enable **OS account security** (fingerprint, face ID, hardware key, password)
- All participants should stop using their browsers to store form data and passwords
- Password authentication workflow
  1. Open the login page in a **new** browser tab
  1. Instruct your password manager to enter credentials and 2FA token
  1. Operate, do not leave your computer/device
  1. After finishing log out
  1. Click lock icon / Delete cookie in the address bar

### Collaboration

- _No emails if it is possible_
- Issues/ticketing: [Clubhouse](https://www.shortcut.com/) or Trello
- Chat: Slack

### Onboarding for developers

- We run Debian GNU/Linux on an UpCloud cloud instance
- All services run in [UTC timezone](http://yellerapp.com/posts/2015-01-12-the-worst-server-setup-you-can-make.html)
- MariaDB or Percona Server + Apache with HTTP/2 and event MPM + PHP-FPM 7 + Redis
  ([full feature list](/debian-setup/debian-setup.sh#L23))
- Every web application (and website) runs as a separate Linux user
- There are no passwords for Linux users, only SSH keys
- All **non-production** servers are accessible through SSH: **terminal, MySQL tunnel, file upload, code deploy** etc.
- Production servers are not accessible for humans (except through HTTPS)
- TCP ports for web and SSH are heavily protected (maxretry=3) [with Fail2ban](/security/fail2ban-conf)
- Source code is kept in git (version-control system)
- PHP OPcache's [file timestamp validation](/webserver/phpfpm-pools/Skeleton-pool.conf#L30) is off,
  thus PHP files are read once at first access, we use [cachetool](https://github.com/gordalina/cachetool)
  to reset OPcache after code change
- There are *standard* directories for [sessions, upload and tmp](/webserver/phpfpm-pools/Skeleton-pool.conf#L36-L38)
- `.htaccess` files are disabled, Apache rules should be in vhost configuration (it is faster)
- File versioning is not in query string but turned into file names like `filename.002.ext` in URL-s,
  [an Apache rule](/webserver/apache-sites-available/Skeleton-site-ssl.conf#L155-L156) reverts them
- Your web application is protected by a [WAF](https://github.com/szepeviktor/waf4wordpress)
- Blacklisted things:
  FTP/S protocol,
  web-based administration (import, export, backup, cPanel, phpMyAdmin),
  POP3/S protocol

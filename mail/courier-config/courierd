##NAME: prefixes:0
#

prefix="/usr"
exec_prefix="/usr"

##NAME: SYSLOCALE:0
#
# Define the default system locale.
#
# Put whatever's needed here to load the default system locale into a completely
# empty environment.
#
# Example (for Fedora <18/CentOs):
#
#   . /etc/sysconfig/i18n
#
# Fedora 18+:
#   . /etc/locale.conf
#
# Alternatively, manually set the necessary environment variable directly:
#
#   LANG=en_US.utf-8
#

. /etc/environment

##NAME: PATH:0
#
#
#  Specify the default PATH that everything inherits -- including commands
#  executed from individual .courier files

PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin

##NAME: SHELL:0
#
#  The default shell

SHELL=/bin/sh

##NAME: DSNNOTIFY:0
#
#  If you would like to suppress all bounces for mail forwarded via an
#  individual .courier file, uncomment the following:
#
# DSNNOTIFY=N

##NAME: DSNTOAUTHADDR:0
#
#  If DSNTOAUTHADDR=1 and the ESMTP client authenticates, bounces will be
#  sent to the authenticated address, and not the return address the sender
#  provided.  This will work only if:
#
#  * The authenticated address is a full <user@domain> address.
#
#  * The authenticated address does not contain 8bit chars!
#
#  Enabling the DSNTOAUTHADDR=1 setting helps prevent abusive backscatter
#  originating from local users.  Turn it off if you want to.

DSNTOAUTHADDR=0

##NAME: DYNAMICDELIVERIES:0
#
#  If you would like to disable the ability to generate dynamic delivery
#  instructions, set the following variable to 0.  See dot-courier(5)
#  for more information.

DYNAMICDELIVERIES=1

##NAME: AUTH_MKHOMEDIR_SKEL:0
#
# Uncomment this setting to automatically create a home directory when
# the first message is received. If the AUTH_MKHOMEDIR_SKEL environment
# variable is set, and the home directory does not exist, the home
# directory gets created, with its initial contents copied fro
# AUTH_MKHOMEDIR_SKEL which must be a directory, typically /etc/skel.
#
# Note that this must be a complete home directory structure, including
# the maildir. Typically:
#
# mkdir /etc/skel
# chmod 700 /etc/skel
# maildirmak /etc/skel/Maildir
#
# This directory gets copied as is, preserving each file/subdirectory's
# permissions, with only userid/groupid changed to match the account's.
#
# AUTH_MKHOMEDIR_SKEL=/etc/skel

#
##NAME: DEFAULTDELIVERY:0
#
#  Specify default delivery instructions by setting DEFAULTDELIVERY
#  One of the following definitions of DEFAULTDELIVERY should be
#  uncommented.
#
#  Default deliveries to $HOME/Maildir
#
#  DEFAULTDELIVERY=./Maildir
#
#  Alternatively, use procmail to deliver mail to local mailboxes.
#
#  DEFAULTDELIVERY="| /usr/bin/preline /usr/bin/procmail"
#
#  Here's how to have maildrop handle local deliveries.
#
#  DEFAULTDELIVERY="| /usr/bin/maildrop"
#
#  If you want to automatically enable .forward support globally,
#  use something like this:
#
#  DEFAULTDELIVERY="|| dotforward
#  ./Maildir"
#
#  Yes, it's two lines long, with an embedded newline.  Of course, you can use
#  any default local mail delivery instruction in place of ./Maildir.

DEFAULTDELIVERY=./Maildir

##NAME: MAILDROPDEFAULT:0
#
#  The following setting initializes the DEFAULT variable in maildrop,
#  the location of the default mailbox.  You should not change this setting
#  unless you REALLY know what you're doing.

MAILDROPDEFAULT=./Maildir

##NAME: ESMTP_CORK:0
#
#  ESMTP_CORK=1 is an extension used with Linux kernel >2.2 that avoids sending
#  partial frames when sending a message via ESMTP.  Set ESMTP_CORK to 0 to
#  disable it (diagnostic option).  In certain situations this option has no
#  effect.  For example, when using SSL the entire channel has an encryption
#  layer around, so courieresmtp is actually talking to a pipe.

ESMTP_CORK=1

##NAME: ESMTP_BLOCKBACKSCATTER:0
#
# Default setting of ESMTP_BLOCKBACKSCATTER drops backscatter bounces.
#
# "Backscatter" is generally defined as a non-delivery notice sent to a
# forged return address.  Since we all know that anyone can use any return
# address on unauthenticated SMTP mail, any bounce message may potentially
# go to a victim of E-mail forgery.
#
# Courier is very good at refusing unwanted mail, and should rarely
# bounce a message after accepting it.  Still, sometimes this can happen,
# usually due to a rejection by a local mail filter.
#
# This is the default setting:
#
# ESMTP_BLOCKBACKSCATTER=smtp/dsn
#
# This setting silently discards a message when all of the following
# conditions are true.
#
# 1) The message is sent via SMTP
# 2) The message is a delivery status notification
# 3) The delivery status notification was in response to a message received
#    via SMTP.
# 4) The original message did not originate from a sender with relaying
#    privileges (not a trusted IP address, no SMTP authentication took place).
#
#
# The following setting does the same thing, except that backscatter from
# senders with relaying privileges is also discarded.
#
# ESMTP_BLOCKBACKSCATTER=smtp/dsn,authsmtp/dsn
#
# To turn off backscatter suppression completely, remove this setting
# altogether.
#
# Do not set this variable to anything else.
#
# Important: if you've configured Courier to enforce mailbox quotas, and
# mailbox overquota is a hard bounce, messages sent to overquota mailboxes
# will be lost!

ESMTP_BLOCKBACKSCATTER=smtp/dsn

##NAME: SOURCE_ADDRESS:0
#
# The SOURCE_ADDRESS and SOURCE_ADDRESS_IPV6 settings have been deprecated and
# replaced by the ipout and ip6out configuration files. See the courier(8)
# man page for more information. These settings will be removed completely in
# a future release.

##NAME: UUXFLAGS:0
#
#  Specify additional flags to uux.  Allowed flags are -g [grade], -j, and
#  -r ONLY.  This environment variable is parsed in a rather simplistic
#  fashion -- it is broken up into space-separate words, and each one is
#  passed to uux together with the mandatory uux flags (namely -p).

UUXFLAGS="-j -g C"

##NAME: ARCHIVEDIR:0
#
#  This is the big-brother option that saves a copy of EACH and EVERY
#  message passing through the system.  Uncomment ARCHIVEDIR, and after
#  a message is delivered, its queue and data file is moved to ARCHIVEDIR
#  instead of being deleted.  You must create the ARCHIVEDIR directory
#  yourself, and it must be owned by the "courier" userid.
#
#  Also, ARCHIVEDIR *MUST* be on the same partition/volume as Courier's
#  mail queue directory.
#
#  All messages will be saved into a flat directory, with one subdirectory
#  created each calendar day.  Therefore, you will need to make sure that
#  your filesystem can handle it.  Each message consists of two files,
#  the control file, and the message data file.  The Linux ext2 filesystem,
#  for example, will start to have problems once there are more than
#  32,000 files in the same directory, so if your system carries a higher
#  daily volume, you'll need to purge out the archive subdirectory several
#  times a day.
#
#  If you fill up an archive directory, mail will continue to move, but
#  not archived.  Caveat emptor.
#
#  ARCHIVEDIR="/usr/lib/courier/bigbrother"

##NAME: ESMTP_USE_STARTTLS:0
#
# The following variables specify whether or not the ESMTP *client* will use
# SSL when talking to a remote ESMTP server that supports SSL.

ESMTP_USE_STARTTLS=1

##NAME: COURIERTLS:0
#
# For SSL to work, OpenSSL must be available when Courier is compiled, and
# couriertls must be installed here:
#
# If couriertls is not installed, ESMTP_USE_TLS is quietly ignored.

COURIERTLS=/usr/bin/couriertls

##NAME: ESMTP_TLS_VERIFY_DOMAIN:0
#
# The following variables specify SSL/TLS properties for the ESMTP SSL client.
#
# Set ESMTP_TLS_VERIFY_DOMAIN to 1 if we must verify the domain in the remote
# server's certificate.  For this to actually work as intended, you must
# install root authority certificates in the locations specified by the
# TLS_TRUSTCERTS setting, and set TLS_VERIFYPEER to PEER.  Otherwise, this is
# meaningless.
#
# This setting must be set to 1 when Courier uses a smarthost that requires
# SMTP SSL certificates for authentication and relaying privileges.

ESMTP_TLS_VERIFY_DOMAIN=1

##NAME: ESMTP_PREFER_IPV6_MX:0
#
# Enable ESMTP_PREFER_IPV6_MX=1 to prefer IPv6 hosts over IPv4.
#
# Remove this setting to prefer IPv4 hosts over IPv6.

ESMTP_PREFER_IPV6_MX=1

##NAME: TLS_PRIORITY:0
#
# Set TLS protocol priority settings (GnuTLS only)
#
# DEFAULT: NORMAL:-CTYPE-OPENPGP
#
# TLS_PRIORITY="NORMAL:-CTYPE-OPENPGP"
#
# This setting is also used to select the available ciphers.
#
# The actual list of available ciphers depend on the options GnuTLS was
# compiled against. The possible ciphers are:
#
# AES256, 3DES, AES128, ARC128, ARC40, RC2, DES, NULL
#
# Also, the following aliases:
#
# HIGH -- all ciphers that use more than a 128 bit key size
# MEDIUM -- all ciphers that use a 128 bit key size
# LOW -- all ciphers that use fewer than a 128 bit key size, the NULL cipher
#        is not included
# ALL -- all ciphers except the NULL cipher
#
# See GnuTLS documentation, gnutls_priority_init(3) for additional
# documentation.

# Modern
# OpenSSL v0.9.8o :+RSA :+SHA1 :+VERS-TLS-ALL
TLS_PRIORITY="NONE:+CHACHA20-POLY1305:+AES-128-GCM:+AES-256-GCM:+AES-128-CBC:+AES-256-CBC:+ECDHE-ECDSA:+ECDHE-RSA:+SHA256:+SHA384:+AEAD:+COMP-NULL:+VERS-TLS1.2:+SIGN-ALL:+CURVE-SECP521R1:+CURVE-SECP384R1:+CURVE-SECP256R1:+CTYPE-X509"

##NAME: TLS_PROTOCOL:0
#
# TLS_PROTOCOL sets the protocol version.  The possible versions are:
#
# OpenSSL:
#
# TLSv1 - TLS1
# TLSv1.1 - TLS1.1
# TLSv1.2 - TLS1.2
#
#
# TLSv1+, TLSv1.1+, and TLSv1.2+ - the corresponding protocol, and all
# higher protocols.
#
# The default value is TLSv1+

##NAME: TLS_CIPHER_LIST:0
#
# TLS_CIPHER_LIST optionally sets the list of ciphers to be used by the
# OpenSSL library.  In most situations you can leave TLS_CIPHER_LIST
# undefined
#
# OpenSSL:
#
# TLS_CIPHER_LIST="SSLv3:TLSv1:HIGH:!LOW:!MEDIUM:!EXP:!NULL:!aNULL@STRENGTH"
#
# GnuTLS:
#
# TLS_CIPHER_LIST="HIGH:MEDIUM"
#
# The actual list of available ciphers depend on the options GnuTLS was
# compiled against. The possible ciphers are:
#
# AES256, 3DES, AES128, ARC128, ARC40, RC2, DES, NULL
#
# Also, the following aliases:
#
# HIGH -- all ciphers that use more than a 128 bit key size
# MEDIUM -- all ciphers that use a 128 bit key size
# LOW -- all ciphers that use fewer than a 128 bit key size, the NULL cipher
#        is not included
# ALL -- all ciphers except the NULL cipher
#
# See GnuTLS documentation, gnutls_priority_init(3) for additional
# documentation.

##NAME: TLS_MIN_DH_BITS:0
#
# TLS_MIN_DH_BITS=n
#
# GnuTLS only:
#
# Set the minimum number of acceptable bits for a DH key exchange.
#
# GnuTLS's compiled-in default is 727 bits (as of GnuTLS 1.6.3). Some server
# have been encountered that offer 512 bit keys. You may have to set
# TLS_MIN_DH_BITS=512 here, if necessary.

##NAME: TLS_TIMEOUT:0
# TLS_TIMEOUT is currently not implemented, and reserved for future use.
# This is supposed to be an inactivity timeout, but its not yet implemented.
#

##NAME: TLS_CERTFILE:0
#
# TLS_CERTFILE - client SSL certificate
#
# This setting must be set when Courier uses a smarthost that requires
# SMTP SSL certificates for authentication and relaying privileges.
#
# TLS_CERTFILE=


##NAME: TLS_TRUSTCERTS:1
#
# TLS_TRUSTCERTS=pathname - load trusted certificates from pathname.
# Use this setting to define SSL certificate authorities
#
# This setting must be set when Courier uses a smarthost that requires
# SMTP SSL certificates for authentication and relaying privileges.

TLS_TRUSTCERTS=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

##NAME: TLS_TRUSTSECURITYCERTS:0
#
# TLS_TRUSTSECURITYCERTS=pathname - same as TLS_TRUSTCERTS, except that
# these certs are used when the Courier-specific SECURITY extension is
# specified for a given message. ESMTP_USE_STARTTLS must be set to 1,
# above, and this option implies ESMTP_TLS_VERIFY_DOMAIN.
#
# This setting, of course, can be same as TLS_TRUSTCERTS, however it is
# often desirable to use a separate, private, root CA cert in order to
# create private, organization-internal, secure mail delivery channel
# over an untrusted network, that's validated by X.509 certs signed
# by a private root CA.
#
# !!!NOTE!!! this is an experimental, not heavily tested, extension
#
# TLS_TRUSTSECURITYCERTS=

##NAME: TLS_VERIFYPEER:1
#
# TLS_VERIFYPEER - how to verify server certificates.  Possible settings:
#
# NONE - do not verify anything
#
# PEER - verify the client certificate, if one's presented
#
# REQUIREPEER - require a client certificate, fail if one's not presented
#
# Most SMTP server certificates on the Internet are self signed, so this
# setting should be left at its default value of "NONE".
#
# This setting must be set to "PEER" when Courier uses a smarthost that requires
# SMTP SSL certificates for authentication and relaying privileges.

TLS_VERIFYPEER=REQUIREPEER

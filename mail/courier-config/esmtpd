#  This configuration file sets various options for Courier's esmtpd server.
#  It is started by couriertcpd, Courier's TCP server.
#  A lot of the stuff here is documented in the manual page for couriertcpd.

##NAME: PATH:0
#
#  Specify the default PATH that everything inherits.

PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin

##NAME: SHELL:0
#
#  The default shell

SHELL=/bin/sh

##NAME: SYSLOGNAME:0
#
# Name that courieresmtpd uses to log to syslog
#
# SYSLOGNAME=courieresmtpd

##NAME: ULIMIT:0
#
#  Sets the maximum size of courieresmtpd's data segment
#

ULIMIT=32768

##NAME: BOFHCHECKDNS:0
#
#  Comment out the following line in order to accept mail with a bad
#  return address.

BOFHCHECKDNS=1

##NAME: BOFHNOEXPN:1
#
#  Set BOFHNOEXP to 1 to disable EXPN

BOFHNOEXPN=1

##NAME: BOFHNOVRFY:1
#
#  Set BOFHNOVERIFY to disable VRFY

BOFHNOVRFY=1

##NAME: TARPIT:1
#
#  Set TARPIT to 0 to disable tarpitting

TARPIT=1

##NAME: NOADDMSGID:0
#
#  The following environment variables keep Courier from adding
#  default Date: and Message-ID: header to messages which do not have them.
#  If you would like to add default headers only for mail from certain
#  IP address ranges, you can override them in couriertcpd access file,
#  see couriertcpd(8).

NOADDMSGID=1

##NAME: NOADDDATE:0
#

NOADDDATE=1

##NAME: NOADDRREWRITE:0
#
# Don't rewrite To:, From:, and Cc: headers.  Set to 2 in order to omit
# rewriting them only if there is a DKIM-Signature.

NOADDRREWRITE=0

##NAME: ESMTP_LOG_DIALOG:0
#
#  If set, log the esmtp dialog.

ESMTP_LOG_DIALOG=0

##NAME: AUTH_REQUIRED:0
#
# Set AUTH_REQUIRED to 1 in order to force the client to use ESMTP
# authentication.  You can override AUTH_REQUIRED on a per-IP address basis
# using smtpaccess.  See makesmtpaccess(8).
#
# This setting requires ESMTP authentication from everyone. Since all
# other mail servers on the Internet will not have a valid password to
# authenticate with, this setting should not be enabled on mail servers
# used to receive incoming mail from the Internet.

AUTH_REQUIRED=0

#########################################################################
#
##NAME: COURIERTLS:0
#
# The following variables configure ESMTP STARTTLS.  If OpenSSL or GnuTLS
# is available during configuration, the couriertls helper gets compiled, and
# upon installation a dummy TLS_CERTFILE gets generated. courieresmtpd will
# automatically advertise the ESMTP STARTTLS extension if both TLS_CERTFILE
# and COURIERTLS exist.
#
# WARNING: Peer certificate verification has NOT yet been tested.  Proceed
# at your own risk.  Only the basic SSL/TLS functionality is known to be
# working. Keep this in mind as you play with the following variables.

COURIERTLS=/usr/bin/couriertls

##NAME: ESMTP_TLS_REQUIRED:0
#
# Set ESMTP_TLS_REQUIRED to 1 if you REQUIRE SSL/TLS to be used for receiving
# mail.  Setting it here will require it for every connection.  You can also
# set ESMTP_TLS_REQUIRED in the smtpaccess file, see makesmtpaccess(8) for
# more information
#
# ESMTP_TLS_REQUIRED=1

##NAME: TLS_PRIORITY:0
#
# GnuTLS setting only
#
# Set TLS protocol priority settings (GnuTLS only)
#
# DEFAULT: NORMAL:-CTYPE-OPENPGP
#
# TLS_PRIORITY="NORMAL:-CTYPE-OPENPGP"

##NAME: TLS_PROTOCOL:0
#
# TLS_PROTOCOL sets the protocol version.  The possible versions are:
#
# OpenSSL:
#
# TLSv1 - TLS1
# TLSv1.1 - TLS1.1
# TLSv1.2 - TLS1.2
#
# TLSv1+, TLSv1.1+, and TLSv1.2+ - the corresponding protocol, and all
# higher protocols.
#
# The default value is TLSv1+

##NAME: TLS_CIPHER_LIST:0
#
# TLS_CIPHER_LIST optionally sets the list of ciphers to be used by the
# OpenSSL library.  In most situations you can leave TLS_CIPHER_LIST
# undefined
#
# OpenSSL:
#
# TLS_CIPHER_LIST="TLSv1:HIGH:!LOW:!MEDIUM:!EXP:!NULL:!aNULL@STRENGTH"
#
#

##NAME: TLS_MIN_DH_BITS:0
#
# TLS_MIN_DH_BITS=n
#
# GnuTLS only:
#
# Set the minimum number of acceptable bits for a DH key exchange.
#
# GnuTLS's compiled-in default is 727 bits (as of GnuTLS 1.6.3). Some server
# have been encountered that offer 512 bit keys. You may have to set
# TLS_MIN_DH_BITS=512 here, if necessary.

##NAME: TLS_TIMEOUT:0
# TLS_TIMEOUT is currently not implemented, and reserved for future use.
# This is supposed to be an inactivity timeout, but its not yet implemented.

##NAME: TLS_CERTFILE:0
#
# TLS_CERTFILE - certificate to use.  TLS_CERTFILE is required for SSL/TLS
# servers, and is optional for SSL/TLS clients.  TLS_CERTFILE is usually
# treated as confidential, and must not be world-readable. Set TLS_CERTFILE
# instead of TLS_DHCERTFILE if this is a garden-variety certificate
#
#
# VIRTUAL HOSTS ON THE SAME IP ADDRESS.
#
# Install each certificate $TLS_CERTFILE.domain, so if TLS_CERTFILE is set to
# /etc/certificate.pem, then you'll need to install the actual certificate
# files as /etc/certificate.pem.www.example.com,
# /etc/certificate.pem.www.domain.com and so on. Then, create a link from
# $TLS_CERTFILE to whichever certificate you consider to be the main one,
# for example:
# /etc/certificate.pem => /etc/certificate.pem.www.example.com
#
# IP-BASED VIRTUAL HOSTS:
#
# There may be a need to support older SSL/TLS client that don't support
# virtual hosts on the same IP address, and require a dedicated IP address
# for each SSL/TLS host. If so, install each certificate file as
# $TLS_CERTFILE.aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd, where "aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd" is the IP address
# for the certificate's domain name. So, if TLS_CERTFILE is set to
# /etc/certificate.pem, then you'll need to install the actual certificate
# files as /etc/certificate.pem.192.168.0.2, /etc/certificate.pem.192.168.0.3
# and so on, for each IP address.
#
# In all cases, $TLS_CERTFILE needs to be linked to one of the existing
# certificate files.

TLS_CERTFILE=/etc/courier/esmtpd.pem

##NAME: TLS_DHPARAMS:0
#
# TLS_DHPARAMS - DH parameter file.
#
TLS_DHPARAMS=/etc/courier/dhparams.pem

##NAME: TLS_TRUSTCERTS:0
#
# TLS_TRUSTCERTS=pathname - load trusted certificates from pathname.
# pathname can be a file or a directory. If a file, the file should
# contain a list of trusted certificates, in PEM format. If a
# directory, the directory should contain the trusted certificates,
# in PEM format, one per file and hashed using OpenSSL's c_rehash
# script. TLS_TRUSTCERTS is used by SSL/TLS clients (by specifying
# the -domain option) and by SSL/TLS servers (TLS_VERIFYPEER is set
# to PEER or REQUIREPEER).
#
#
# TLS_TRUSTCERTS=

TLS_TRUSTCERTS=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

##NAME: TLS_VERIFYPEER:0
#
# TLS_VERIFYPEER - how to verify peer certificates.  The possible values of
# this setting are:
#
# NONE - do not verify anything
#
# PEER - verify the peer certificate, if one's presented
#
# REQUIREPEER - require a peer certificate, fail if one's not presented
#
# SSL/TLS servers will usually set TLS_VERIFYPEER to NONE.  SSL/TLS clients
# will usually set TLS_VERIFYPEER to REQUIREPEER.
#
TLS_VERIFYPEER=NONE

##NAME: TLS_EXTERNAL:0
#
# To enable SSL certificate-based authentication:
#
# 1) TLS_TRUSTCERTS must be set to a pathname that holds your certificate
#    authority's SSL certificate
#
# 2) TLS_VERIFYPEER=PEER or TLS_VERIFYPEER=REQUIREPEER (the later settings
#    requires all SSL clients to present a certificate, and rejects
#    SSL/TLS connections without a valid cert).
#
# 3) Set TLS_EXTERNAL, below, to the subject field that holds the login ID.
#    Example:
#
#  TLS_EXTERNAL=emailaddress
#
# The above example retrieves the login ID from the "emailaddress" subject
# field. The certificate's emailaddress subject must match exactly the login
# ID in the courier-authlib database.

##NAME: MAILUSERGROUP:0
#
#  Mail user and group

MAILUSER=courier
MAILGROUP=courier

##NAME: ADDRESS:0
#
#  Address to listen on, can be set to a single IP address.
#

ADDRESS=127.0.0.1

##NAME: PORT:1
#
#  PORT specified the port number to listen on.  The standard "smtp" port
#  is port 25.
#
#  Multiple port numbers can be separated by commas.  When multiple port
#  numbers are used it is possibly to select a specific IP address for a
#  given port as "ip.port".  For example, "127.0.0.1.900,192.68.0.1.900"
#  accepts connections on port 900 on IP addresses 127.0.0.1 and 192.68.0.1
#  The ADDRESS setting, if given, is a default for ports that do not have
#  a specified IP address.

PORT=smtp

##NAME: BLACKLISTS:1
#
#  Blacklists we query.
#
#  The BLOCK environment variable is automatically enforced by submit.
#  Nobody really does anything about BLOCK2, this is mainly for use by
#  plug-in mail filters.  If you want Courier to unilaterally block
#  mail from IP addresses listed by Spamhaus or CBL, and you have a separate
#  localmailfilter that keys off BLOCK2, uncomment the following.  If you want
#  to unilaterally block everything listed by Spamhaus or CBL, just replace
#  BLOCK2 with BLOCK.
#
# BLACKLISTS='-block=zen.spamhaus.org,BLOCK2 -block=cbl.abuseat.org,BLOCK2'
#
# The BLACKLISTS setting can also contain -allow options to implement
# DNS-based whitelists. See the couriertcpd(1) man page for more information.
# The -block and -allow options from this setting are passed directly to
# couriertcpd(1).

BLACKLISTS=""

##NAME: ALLOW_EXCLUSIVE:0
#
# The -allow option adds an Authentication-Results: header to a received
# message, if the sender's IP was found in the -allow lookup.
#
# If you use -allow to implement whitelists, you should set ALLOW_EXCLUSIVE=1.
# This renames any existing Authentication-Results: headers in a received
# message to Old-Authentication-Results, so any Authentication-Results:
# in the received message will always come from this server. Otherwise, the
# sender can trivially spoof it.
#
# ALLOW_EXCLUSIVE=1

##NAME: DROP:0
#
#  Drop blacklisted connections immediately, rather than postponing them and
#  having all ESMTP transactions rejected.
#
#  By default, all ESMTP transactions from blacklisted IP addresses are
#  rejected. Uncomment this setting to immediately drop connections, instead.
#  See the couriertcpd man page for more information about the -drop
#  option to couriertcpd.
#
# DROP="-drop"

##NAME: ACCESSFILE:1
#
#  Access file: $ACCESSFILE - plain text file/dir, $ACCESSFILE.dat - compiled
#  database.
#

ACCESSFILE=${sysconfdir}/smtpaccess

##NAME: MAXDAEMONS:0
#
#  Maximum number of daemons started
#

MAXDAEMONS=40

##NAME: MAXPERC:0
#
#  Maximum number of connections accepted from the same C address block
#

MAXPERC=5

##NAME: MAXPERID:0
#
#
#  Maximum number of connections accepted from the same IP address

MAXPERIP=5

##NAME: PIDFILE:0
#
#  File where couriertcpd will save its process ID
#

PIDFILE=/run/courier/esmtpd.pid

##NAME: TCPDOPTS:3
#
# TCPDOPTS can contain other couriertcpd options, such as
# -nodnslookup and -noidentlookup.
#

# Don't look up localhost
TCPDOPTS="-stderrlogger=/usr/sbin/courierlogger -noidentlookup -nodnslookup"

##NAME: ESMTPAUTH:4
#
# To enable authenticated SMTP relaying, uncomment the ESMTPAUTH setting,
# below, and set it to ESMTP authentication mechanisms we support.  Currently
# LOGIN and CRAM-MD5 are available:
#
# ESMTPAUTH="LOGIN"
#
# You can also try PLAIN. CRAM-MD5, CRAM-SHA1, and CRAM-SHA256 may also be
# specified, if CRAM authentication has been configured.  See INSTALL for more
# information.
#

ESMTPAUTH=""

##NAME: ESMTPAUTH_WEBADMIN:5
#
# ESMTPAUTH_WEBADMIN is used by the webadmin module
#
# Don't touch this setting.

ESMTPAUTH_WEBADMIN="LOGIN CRAM-MD5 CRAM-SHA1 CRAM-SHA256"

##NAME: ESMTPAUTHINFOTLS:3
#
# To enable SASL PLAIN authentication when using TLS, uncomment the following.
# To enable SASL PLAIN with or without TLS, just add PLAIN to ESMTPAUTH,
# above:
#
# ESMTPAUTH_TLS="PLAIN LOGIN CRAM-MD5"
#
# ESMTPAUTH_TLS_WEBADMIN is used by the webadmin module

ESMTPAUTH_TLS=""

##NAME: ESMTPAUTH_TLS_WEBADMIN:5

ESMTPAUTH_TLS_WEBADMIN="PLAIN LOGIN CRAM-MD5 CRAM-SHA1 CRAM-SHA256"

##NAME: ESMTPDSTART:0
#
# ESMTPDSTART is not referenced anywhere in the standard Courier programs
# or scripts.  Rather, this is a convenient flag to be read by your system
# startup script in /etc/rc.d, like this:
#
#  prefix=/usr
#  exec_prefix=/usr
#  . ${sysconfdir}/esmtpd
#  case x$ESMTPDSTART in
#  x[yY]*)
#        /usr/sbin/esmtpd start
#        ;;
#  esac
#
# The default setting is going to be NO, until Courier is shipped by default
# with enough platforms so that people get annoyed with having to flip it to
# YES every time.

ESMTPDSTART=YES
